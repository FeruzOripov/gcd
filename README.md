# gcd
GCD compute microservice in gRPC with gin API.

One microservice will be responsible for calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers. That's not something that requires building a separate service, but it will serve as an introductory example just fine. The other will serve a public REST API, and depend on first service when needed.
